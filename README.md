## Pomodoro Clock built with React
This is one of the hallenges from the FreeCodeCamp front end development course.  A pomodoro clock is a work tool used to structure your working time throughout the day.  The idea is to set specific working sessions, followed by short break periods.

This clock allows you to set working times up to 60 minutes.  Use the selection arrows to set specific time lengths.

Once a break or session has completed, a short sound clip will play to notify you.
